# SF Waste

SF Waste gives you information about the local San Francisco waste (compost, recycling, landfill and more) methods. It provides details on individual items and related terms within the Search tool. There are additional resources available such as printable posters, instructional videos and external links to find out more.

The app is built with React and utilizes a local, static database. Currently, the photos for individual items are using the Unsplash API.

## Project

The purpose behind this project was to learn more about the React best practices, especially using routes and links, public APIs, and a local database. The content and general idea of the app came from the local SF waste company, Recology. My idea was to build a more user friendly search tool for individual items while providing the user additional waste information.

The user interface was designed to be mobile responsive.

### Search Tool

The “What Bin?” search tool provides the main functionality of the app. A user can learn more information about a specific item’s waste instructions. They can type in a specific item (such as “Eggs” or “Coffee grounds”) and see the information regarding waste type, related items, and a general description.

It highlights the waste method icon and shows a display card with a small action sentence indicating how to dispose of this item. If the item is not in the database, the user will receive an error message instead of a result.

### Guides

The guides section displays and lists different posters and flyers for the user to print out and use. Each listed link goes to an external PDF file via Recology.

### Learn More

The learn more section provides more information on composting and recycling, such as their meaning and benefits.

There are also additional video resources from Recology for training and overview info.
